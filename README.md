# Open-Source FIX Server and Matching Engine

At Bitwyre we are building a way to allow ordinary people to access foreign-exchange (FX)
market in the advent of an adversary (government's central bank currency controls for example).
This technology is invented to make capital flows completely anonymous.

The core idea is to build a foreign-exchange matching engine, database, and wallet service
which is totally open-source so traditional banks could upgrade their system, while Bitwyre
Technologies's a distributed dark-pool across multiple continents Macau, BVI, Delaware, Swiss.
